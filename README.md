Slots are variables used by intents to gather necessary data.

### Steps to Add Custom Slots:

1. Go to **Slot types** on the left panel.

## 8. üîó Connecting AWS Lambda

Amazon Lex can delegate fulfillment logic to Lambda functions.

### Step-by-Step:

1. Go to AWS Lambda ‚Üí Create Function
2. Runtime: Python 3.9 (or 3.8)
3. Function Name: `ResumeBotLambda`

### Sample Python Lambda Code:
```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
  intent_name = event['sessionState']['intent']['name']
  
  if intent_name == 'UnderstandUser':
      return {
          "sessionState": {
              "dialogAction": {
                  "type": "Close"
              },
              "intent": {
                  "name": "UnderstandUser",
                  "state": "Fulfilled"
              }
          },
          "messages": [{
              "contentType": "PlainText",
              "content": "I have worked as a Data Engineer at Amazon. Some of my key projects include setting up data pipelines using Glue and Athena..."
          }]
      }
````

4. Deploy the function.
5. In Lex ‚Üí Intent settings ‚Üí **Lambda Initialization and Fulfillment**, attach the Lambda function.
